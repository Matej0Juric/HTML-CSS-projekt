		<p>Heroes of Might and Magic III: Horn of the Abyss is an expansion pack for the popular turn-based strategy game Heroes of Might and Magic III. </p>
		<p>It was developed by a team of modders and fans of the game, known as the Horn of the Abyss team.</p> 
		<p>The Horn of the Abyss team is made up of volunteers who are passionate about the Heroes of Might and Magic series, and who wanted to add new content and improve the gameplay experience for fellow fans of the game. </p>
		<p>They worked tirelessly to create the expansion pack, and their efforts were well received by the community, with the expansion pack becoming one of the most popular and highly-rated mods for Heroes of Might and Magic III.</p>	
		<p>The expansion pack adds new features and content to the base game, including new campaigns, maps, creatures, and artifacts. </p>
		<p>It also introduces new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to build ships and explore the seas, and the ability to construct and upgrade buildings in your towns.</p>	
		<p>The Horn of the Abyss expansion pack was released in 2012, and is still actively supported and updated by the team to this day. 
		<p>If you're a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic III, I highly recommend giving it a try!</p>
